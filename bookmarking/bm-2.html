    <img src="./hare and tortoise.jpg" width="500px"></center>
    <p style="font-size: large;">There was once a hare who was friends with a tortoise. One day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. Seeing how slow the tortoise was going, the hare thought he’d win this easily. So, he took a nap while the tortoise kept on going. When the hare woke, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. Much to his chagrin, the tortoise won the race while he was busy sleeping.</p>

        The hare teaches that overconfidence can sometimes ruin you. While the tortoise teaches us about the power of perseverance. Even if all the odds are stacked against you, never give up.

    <p style="font-size: large;">
        After flying a long distance, a thirsty crow wandered the forest searching for water. Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water. He tried to drink from it, but his beak wasn’t long enough to reach the water inside. He then saw pebbles on the ground, and one by one, he put them in the pot until the water rose to the brim. The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.

    <img src="./the miser and his gold.webp" width="500px"></center>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
        Once, there was a miser who would hide all his gold under the stones in his garden. He never spent his gold, and without fail, he would count his coins before going to bed every day. One day a thief spotted him counting his coins. After the miser went to sleep, the thief stole all the gold. The next day, the miser saw that all his gold was missing and started wailing. His neighbours came running and asked him what had happened. The neighbours asked him why he didn’t keep the gold in the house since it would be easy to access inside. The mise revealed he never planned on spending the gold. The neighbours told him he might as well save his stones, as the unused gold was just as useless.

    <p style="font-size: large;">
        There was a young boy who could not control his anger. He would say whatever came to his mind, even if it hurts people. His father asked him to hammer in a nail in the backyard fence whenever he got angry. In the beginning, he used up a lot of nails. But as time went by, he started using less. The father then asked him to start removing a nail each day; he didn’t get angry. When he removed all the nails, the father asked him to see the holes in the fence. He reminded him that the fence would never be the same. Likewise, the things he had said to people could never be erased.
